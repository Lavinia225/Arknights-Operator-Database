# Arknights Operator Database

Arknights Operator Database is both a operator search system and a Damage Per Second(DPS)/Healing Per Second(HPS) calculator. 

You can use it to find a list of operators that meet search requirements by faction, class, archetype, or birthplace. Searching an operator by name takes
you directly to their profile. 

In addition, the DPS/HPS tool is included to help with sorting out damage/healing for bossing or sorting out if you have enough damage/healing to clear a stage.

## Usage

Clicking PRTS returns you to the start.

#### Searching Operators

Click a faction to receive a list of all operators within the faction. 
Or use the searchbar to find operators by various catagories. When searching by name, you are taken directly to the operator's profile.
Another way to go to their profile is to click their name in the search lists. 

#### Damage Per Second / Healing Per Second Calculator

After toggling on select-mode, clicking an operator's name in their profile or in any search list will add them to your squad. You can then
click 'Calculate DPS/HPS' to receive the total damage and healing values of your team. Clicking an operator within your squad removes them.

#### Editing Operators

Click 'edit' within an operator profile to edit them. The form will prefill the current data, and after a successful edit, re-renders the profile.
